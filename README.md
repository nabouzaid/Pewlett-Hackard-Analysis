## Summary 

### Retiring employees and mentorship

  * There are 91 298 employees retiring (born 1952 to 1955) but only 1550 employees eligible for mentorship and close to retirement which is not sufficient to mentor the next generation

### Additional Investigations

  * A table with the number of employees currently employed at the company and recently hired may give insight into the current hiring rate 
  * A table with birth year count by job title may give insight into how the loss of senior employees can be compensated for
